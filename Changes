Revision history for Perl extension Embedix::ECD.

+ means it still needs to be done
- means it's done

1.00  TARGET
    - be able to create an object tree from a file
    - be able to render an object tree
    + grammar capable of detecting imbalanced tags and unknown attributes
    + freeze the API after having discussed it w/ others who care
      (but I'm the only one who seems to care)
    + documentation should be complete
    + the subclasses of Embedix::ECD should begin to take on individual
      characteristics (because they can't all be the same).  It annoys
      me that they are all clones of eachother.
    - submit to CPAN -- when is my PAUSE id coming in? (on my bday of course!)
    + split the constructors that rely on the parser out into
      a factory class.  (maybe)
    + allow for negative indentation?

    - The grammar was simplified and also made capable of detecting
      imbalanced tags.  This means that the parser will die when
      an error is detected so be sure to wrap calls to the constructors
      around an eval block.
    - wrote documentation regarding these new error messages.
    - added n() which is an alias for getChild().  I think they should
      have disallowed "-" from node names.
    - added Embedix::ECD::XMLWriter -- much work needs to be done.
    - write tests for rendering
    - newFromCons() and grammar changed such that nodes are
      returned as a pair in an arrayref.  Everything still works
      the same.
    - added bin/ecd2xml
    - discovered Pod::Usage(3pm) -- perl module of the week!
    - added ecd_v1.dtd which is a straight port of the ECD format
      to XML
    - added function xml_from_cons() which takes an arrayref 
      (NOT an Embedix::ECD object) and turns it into XML.  It even
      preserves comments!
    - added getNodeType() method to Embedix::ECD
    - fleshed out toXML().  It now takes a "dtd" parameter which can
      be "yes", "embed", or "no".  This determines how the 
      document type declaration is mentioned in the XML.
    - "&" in CDATA gets turned into an &amp; entity.
    - ecd_v1.dtd adjusted to have element order coincide w/ the way
      Embedix::ECD usually orders them.  Otherwise, it's invalid.  :(
      The dtd was also changed to allow the nesting of group, component,
      option, and autovar nodes.  (I forgot about that).
      Everything should be well-formed now, and the stuff toXML() spits
      out should even be valid.  The stuff xml_from_cons() spits out will
      probably not be valid, though -- I don't have control over the order
      of attributes when I get a cons.
    - this is the first version to be put into CPAN.
      Getting my PAUSE id today was the best birthday present I've
      ever gotten.

    - implemented mergeWith()
    - refactor subclasses of Embedix::ECD to minimize duplication of code
    - wrote more documentation about what an ECD actually is and
      reorganized some of the sections to (hopefully) make it easier
      to understand.
    - added getFormatOptions(@opt) method to further reduce duplication
      of code in the subclasses.

    - overloaded the "" operator like CGI::Cookie
    - create methods for accessing known attributes
    - added newFromCons() which takes a big arrayref and turns it
      into a bigger Embedix::ECD object.
    - added setAttribute($name, $value) and getAttribute($name) to
      make newFromCons() much easier to implement w/o violating
      abstraction or having to eval.
    - updated POD for methods such that each method is preceded by
      Embedix::ECD (if it is a class method) or $ecd (if it is an
      instance method).
    - added getDepth() to find one's depth in the tree.
      Unfortunately, overloading "" seemed to conflict with reference
      comparisons and really screwed things up, so I may end up disabling
      overloading.
    - re-enabled the overloaded "" operator.  Instead of checking to
      see if $parent eq undef, I just do ref($parent) which seems
      to not make the "" kick in (which is a good thing).
    - the grammar now has a way to turn the attributes that are supposed
      to be aggregates into aggregates via __unindent_and_aggregate()
    - added module Embdix::ECD::Util and in it, indent()
      more utility functions will be added there as necessary.
    - overloading "" is pissing me off -- it kicks in when I least expect it.
      No more overloading for me.
    - subclasses need to implement their own toString()
      ...but it got messy
    - added %default and @attribute_order to Embedix::ECD::Util
      They're probably going to get moved somewhere else.
    - I decided that ALL attributes that get delimited by tags
      are aggregates.  There is no longer a distinction between
      singular and aggregate attributes.
    - added accessor method for default_value (which was accidentally
      omitted).

    - made the parser collect consecutive comments into one big comment.
      Removed join_comments method, because of this.
    - removed debugging noise from the parser
    - wrote great quantities of POD
    - added Embedix/ECD/Autovar.pm
    - provided an intervening layer in the grammar so that one could
      get a nested arrayref form of the syntax tree instead of an object
    - API changes for accessing child nodes.  AUTOLOAD will no longer be
      able to add children.  addChild() will have to be used for that
      task.  getChild() was added for those times it would be inconvenient
      to let AUTOLOAD return a child node.  Finally children() was renamed
      to getChildren().  This was the result of my desire to let the methods
      for accessing attribute names be nouns.  I also want all other methods
      to have a verb in them.  Thus children() became getChildren().
    - enhanced the basic constructor, new()

0.03  Fri Nov 10 12:16:27 MST 2000
    - more additions to the grammar
    - added a stub for merge().
    - added a stub for join_comments().
    - added t/data/node.ecd which is an ECD file that only
      contains nodes.
    - this is the first time a grammar has been able to load an ECD file
      in its entirety into a simple perl data structure.

0.02  Tue Aug 29 16:38:47 MDT 2000
    - implemented AUTOLOAD method
    - added a test for building object hierarchies
    - implemented new_from_file() constructor
    - preliminary (very wrong) ECD parser
    - added children() method for returning all children of a node.
    - switched to Java-styled method names for pre-defined methods.
      newFromFile() and newFromString() were changed.
